<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Barrier Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire barrier sealant market includes two primary types: elastomeric and intumescent sealants. Elastomeric sealants are flexible, rubber-like materials that effectively prevent the passage of smoke and fire between different construction elements. They provide durability and are suitable for a variety of applications. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to heat, forming a char that blocks fire and smoke. This unique characteristic makes them ideal for fire-rated walls and ceilings, enhancing building safety.</p></p>
